# PicoScope Python Integration

## Description:

This repository focuses on the development of an application to simplify interfacing with PicoScope devices using Python APIs. The primary objective is to create a seamless and efficient development experience for developers looking to integrate PicoScope devices into their projects.

## Features:

1. **Easy Interface:** A Python API wrapper that simplifies communication between the application and PicoScope devices.

2. **FFT Analyzer:** Development of an FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) analyzer function to enable users to perform complex frequency domain analyses.

3. **Comprehensive Testing:** The application will undergo rigorous testing to ensure reliability and accuracy.

4. **Comparison with Real Devices:** The output of the FFT analyzer will be cross-verified with actual devices to ensure authenticity and precision.

## Future Scope:

This project aims not only to fulfill current requirements but also to adapt to future needs. As Pico Technology evolves and adds more features to its devices, this application will continue to be refined and expanded to support new functionalities.
